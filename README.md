### 1. Understanding a Basic GAN
If you got a crush on any of those people below then I got a bad news for you. These people are not real! The images have actually been downloade from the website [thispersondoesnotexist.com](thispersondoesnotexist.com). It is hard to believe that an AI can generate such realistic fake images of a person in matter of seconds but that is the reality in which we are actually living. This AI face generator is powered by ```StyleGAN```, a neural network from NVIDIA developed in 2018.

**Fun fact:** The main goal was to train the AI to recognize fake faces and faces in general. The company needed this to improve the performance of its video cards by automatically recognizing faces and applying other rendering algorithms to them. However, since the StyleGAN code is publicly available, an engineer at Uber was able to take it and create a random face generator that rocked the internet!

Another interesting application of GAN is ```Deepfake```. Haven't you even wondered what the movie ```American Psycho``` would look like if we had ```Tom Cruise``` as the protagonist instead of ```Christian Bale```. Here's a preview:

Pretty great, right? Now the most important question we must ask is: **How to recognize the fake from the real?** It is almost impossible to recognise an image of a fake person. AI is so developed that 90% of fakes are not recognized by an ordinary person and 50% are not recognized by an experienced photographer. However, occasionally a neural network makes mistakes, which is why artifacts appear: an incorrectly bent pattern, a strange hair color, and so on.

[whichfaceisreal.com](https://www.whichfaceisreal.com/) has been developed by Jevin West and Carl Bergstrom at the University of Washington, as part of the Calling Bullshit project, which focus on teaching people to be more analytical of potentially false portraits. I tested it and it is not that straightforward!
